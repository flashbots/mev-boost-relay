# Agnostic Relay

[Agnostic Relay](http://agnostic-relay.net/) is an open-source MEV Boost relay available to anyone, anywhere in the world, without prejudice or privilege. Agnostic Relay is an ideal relay for block producers and block builders trying to provide neutral features powered by Gnosis's know-how and experience.

Agnostic Relay is a fork of [Flashbots mev-boost relay](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay).

# Motivation and Context

We want to build a world where open competition is possible - the entrenched tool, the infrastructure must be credibly neutral/censorship resistant.  Building credibly neutral tools is also a critical step and that’s why we want to run the Agnostic Relay.

As defined by Ethereum.org, a validator is a node in a proof-of-stake system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
 
The neutrality of a protocol is undermined if different rules apply for which contracts will be validated. 

All content should be treated equally.

Prioritizing credible neutrality sends a clear message about what Gnosis values are and therefore the importance of the Agnostic Relay.
